### Course Objectives
In this course, students will learn how to manage projects using open-source principles and tools, as well as how to manage distributed collaborations. These skills include learning how to work with version-control systems, managing projects according to the principles of “working open”, and managing distributed and asynchronous communities. Open-source techniques provide small projects with bureaucratic flexibility and access to collaborators from around the world. Managing the open-source way, particularly through the use of open-source communities, is growing in popularity among large corporations and startups alike.
