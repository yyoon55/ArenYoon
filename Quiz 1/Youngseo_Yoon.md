## Overview of Markdown Language
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting text. It allows you to write using a plain text format, which is then converted into styled text such as headings, lists, bold text, italicized text, images, and tables. Markdown is widely used in platforms like GitHub, forums, and documentation systems because it is simple and easy to read.

### Headings

Markdown uses # symbols to create headings. The number of # symbols determines the heading level. For example:

# Heading 1 creates the largest heading.
## Heading 2 is a subheading.
### Heading 3 is a smaller subheading.

### Text Formatting

You can style text in Markdown using various symbols:

- Bold text is created by enclosing it in ** or __. For example: **Bold** or __Bold__ becomes Bold.
- Italic text is created using * or _. For example: *Italic* or _Italic_ becomes Italic.
- Strikethrough text is created using ~~. For example: ~~Strikethrough~~ becomes Strikethrough.
- You can combine styles, such as **_Bold and Italic_**, which becomes Bold and Italic.
- To create a bulleted list, use a hyphen - or an asterisk * followed by a space.
  - Example:
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    - Item 3
- For numbered lists, simply write the numbers followed by periods:
  - First item
  - Second item
  - Third item

### Images

To insert an image, use the following syntax: ![Alt Text](image-url).
For example:
![Example](https://placehold.co/600x400) will display the image, with "Alt Text" as a description if the image cannot load.

#### Links

To create a link, use the format [Link Text](URL). For example:
[Visit Google](https://www.google.com) will appear as Visit Google.

### Tables

Markdown supports simple tables using vertical bars | to separate columns and hyphens - to create headers.
For example:

| Header 1  | Header 2  | Header 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell 1 | Cell2 | Cell 3 |
